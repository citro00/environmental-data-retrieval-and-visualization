# environmental-data-retrieval-and-visualization
This project involves the use of two Sparkfun Artemis Redboards with integrated BLE. A BME280 sensor is connected to one, and a micro OLED to the other. The devices are connected via a Bluetooth connection. The device with the BME280 sensor takes environmental data, which is then sent to the other device via Bluetooth for display on the screen.
